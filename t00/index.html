    <h2 id="makes">What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>
      A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do
      them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a
      superhero,
      <b
        >you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human
        being could possess</b
      >, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a
      policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police
      story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy
      with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story.
      If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do,
      couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

    <p>Tony Stark</p>
    <p>
      Without his suit of armor, Tony Stark has no supernatural powers. He is
      only limited by his imagination. Tony is a brilliant engineer and has used
      his talents to create a powerful suit of armor that enables the wearer to
      fly, shoot beams of energy from his hands and chest, and resist the vacuum
      of space. The suit also protects the wearer from damage and grants
      superhuman strength.
